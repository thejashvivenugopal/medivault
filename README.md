# Pharmacy Management System

This project is a web application developed for a pharmacy company to streamline the management of pharmacists, customers, and billing medicines. The application consists of a backend developed in Java and a frontend built using React with TypeScript.

## Features
- Pharmacists can create an account by signing up.
- Pharmacists can add customers under their profile.
- Medicines can be billed for a specific customer under the pharmacist's account.

## Project Structure
- **Backend**: Implemented using Java. The entry point is `driver.java`.
- **Frontend**: Implemented using React and TypeScript. The code is located in the `react/medivault` folder.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Version 8 or higher.
- **Node.js**: Version 14 or higher (ensure `npm` is installed as well).

## Setup and Execution

### Backend
1. Navigate to the folder containing `driver.java`.
2. Compile and run the `driver.java` file:
   ```sh
   javac driver.java
   java driver
   ```

### Frontend
1. Navigate to the `react/medivault` folder:
   ```sh
   cd react/medivault
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the frontend and make it accessible at a local development URL.

## Usage
1. Run the backend by following the steps in the [Backend](#backend) section.
2. Start the frontend as described in the [Frontend](#frontend) section.
3. Open your browser and navigate to the frontend URL.
4. Sign up as a pharmacist to create your account.
5. Add customers under your account and manage their details.
